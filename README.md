* [polyProof]()
## Executing program
Under this section, I will provide you the information of how these codes are getting executed, what's the process and will also provide you the Loom video link for the same.
* javascriptBeginners.js : In this, we learnt about how the NFTs are created, the process of creating the variable holding NFTs, their metadata and how those NFTs will get minted and the total number of NFTs which are being supplied. Link to the Loom video to explain all the functionalities of this program. [🔗 Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/aa7d766610994c4ab031540ec9b57869?sid=95d64a66-aedc-4ba5-be96-792636b621c5)
* ethBeginners.sol : This program is a simple contract written in Solidity and can be compiled using Remix IDE. In this contract, we create our own token and can also know which address contains how much amount of token, how much amount of token gets minted or burnt and what is the total supply of the token available. All the functionalities of this contract is explained in the given Loom video, link to that is here. [🔗 Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/a14cc62a907547b78484e825a47c2211?sid=71e1e80a-9d48-4725-8ea3-451ae0b3c1a4).
* eth-avaxIntMod1.sol: This is a simple contract that was programmed just to check that whether the owner of the contract is the same as one using the contract or not. For this, we used three error methods- require(), revert(), and assert() and all these three functions are performing the same job. [🔗 Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/7963578397d94f53a9abcc42516fe84f?sid=fe6ab981-7801-4139-83ce-d97ef1aaa706)
* Eth-Avax Int Module 3: In this file, a smart contract was created and compiled using Local Hardhat network. In this contract, we create our own token and use different functions such as mint fucntion which can be used by the owner only, burn and transfer function can be used by any of the user. The contract has been tested and deployed using Remix IDE. The functionalities of the contract has been explained in this Loom video.
