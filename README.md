# Metacrafters Project
Project that has been assigned in the courses provided by Metacrafters.
## Description
This repository contains the assignments that is made during the learning process. Files names has been given as the course name to avoid the confusions. Given below are the list of files and courses completed in chronological order:
* [javascriptBeginners.js](https://github.com/Harshh18/Metacrafters_project/blob/main/javascriptBeginners.js)
* [ethBeginners.sol](https://github.com/Harshh18/Metacrafters_project/blob/main/ethBeginners.sol)
* [ethAdvance.sol]
* [polyProof]
## Executing program
Under this section, I will provide you the information of how these codes are getting executed, what's the process and will also provide you the Loom video link for the same.
* javascriptBeginners.js : In this, we learnt about how the NFTs are created, the process of creating the variable holding NFTs, their metadata and how those NFTs will get minted and the total number of NFTs which are being supplied. Link to the Loom video to explain all the functionalities of this program. [ðŸ”— Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/aa7d766610994c4ab031540ec9b57869?sid=95d64a66-aedc-4ba5-be96-792636b621c5)
* ethBeginners.sol : This program is a simple contract written in Solidity and can be compiled using Remix IDE. In this contract, we create our own token and can also know which address contains how much amount of token, how much amount of token gets minted or burnt and what is the total supply of the token available. All the functionalities of this contract is explained in the given Loom video, link to that is here. [ðŸ”— Loom]().
